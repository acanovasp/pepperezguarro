# ✅ Sanity CMS Integration Complete

The Sanity CMS integration has been successfully implemented! Your website is now ready to accept content from Sanity while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Installed Packages ✅
- `@sanity/client` - Fetch data from Sanity
- `@sanity/image-url` - Generate optimized image URLs
- `next-sanity` - Next.js integration utilities
- `sanity` - Sanity Studio (dev dependency)
- `@sanity/vision` - Query testing tool (dev dependency)

### 2. Sanity Configuration Files ✅
- `sanity/config.ts` - Project configuration
- `sanity/client.ts` - API clients and image URL builder
- `sanity/types.ts` - TypeScript types for Sanity data

### 3. Studio Configuration ✅
- `sanity.config.ts` - Studio interface configuration
- `sanity.cli.ts` - CLI configuration for deployment

### 4. Data Layer Updated ✅
- `lib/data.ts` - Now fetches from Sanity with fallback to placeholder data
- Automatic image transformation with blur placeholders
- Auto-generated alt text: `ProjectTitle-01`, `ProjectTitle-02`, etc.
- Maintains full backward compatibility

### 5. Next.js Configuration ✅

- Maintained all existing performance optimizations

### 6. Package Scripts ✅
Added to `package.json`:
- `npm run sanity` - Start Sanity Studio locally
- `npm run sanity:build` - Build Studio for production
- `npm run sanity:deploy` - Deploy Studio to Sanity hosting

### 7. Environment Files ✅
- `.env.local` - Created with your project credentials
- `.env.example` - Template for other developers

### 8. Documentation ✅
- `SANITY_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide

## 🚀 Next Steps (YOUR ACTION REQUIRED)

### Step 1: Get Your API Token

1. Go to [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)
2. Select project **"PepPerez"** (ID: vynr1qpf)
3. Go to **API** → **Tokens**
4. Click **Add API token**
5. Name: "Production Website Token"
6. Permissions: **Viewer** (or Editor if you want)
7. Copy the token

### Step 2: Add Token to Environment

Edit `.env.local` and add your token:
```
SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk_your_token_here
```

### Step 3: Start Sanity Studio

```bash
npm run sanity
```

This opens Studio at `http://localhost:3333`

### Step 4: Create Content

In Sanity Studio:

**Create About Page:**
1. Click **About** in sidebar
2. Fill in all fields
3. Click **Publish**

**Create Projects:**
1. Click **Projects** in sidebar
2. Click **Create new project**
3. Fill in fields:
   - **Project Number**: 1, 2, 3, etc. (controls order)
   - **Title**: Project name
   - **Slug**: Click "Generate"
   - **Location**, **Year**, **Description**: Fill as needed
   - **Images**: Upload bulk images (supports 70+ images)
   - **Collaboration**, **Client**, **Date**: Optional
4. Click **Publish**

### Step 5: Test Your Website

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` - You should see Sanity content!

## 📊 How It Works

### Dual Mode System

The website operates in two modes:

**Development Mode (Fallback):**
- If Sanity is not configured or has errors → Shows placeholder data
- Website never breaks, always functional
- Perfect for testing and development

**Production Mode (Sanity):**
- When `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` is set → Fetches from Sanity
- Real-time content updates
- Optimized image delivery from Sanity CDN

### Image Optimization

When you upload images to Sanity:
1. **Automatic blur placeholders** (LQIP) are generated
2. **Multiple sizes** created for responsive images
3. **Alt text** auto-generated: `ProjectTitle-01`, `ProjectTitle-02`
4. **CDN delivery** for fast global loading
5. **Next.js Image** component handles optimization

### Project Ordering

Projects are ordered by the **Project Number (Position)** field:
- Number 1 = First project
- Number 2 = Second project
- You can reorder anytime by changing the number

## 🔧 Useful Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start Next.js dev server
npm run sanity           # Start Sanity Studio locally

# Building
npm run build            # Build Next.js for production
npm run sanity:build     # Build Sanity Studio

# Deployment
npm run sanity:deploy    # Deploy Studio to Sanity hosting
```

- API token should be **Viewer** permission for production
- Use **Editor** permission only if client needs to edit from website
- Never commit tokens to git

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Showing placeholder data instead of Sanity content?**
- Check `.env.local` has correct project ID
- Verify API token is set
- Ensure content is **published** (not just saved)
- Restart dev server after changing `.env.local`

**Images not loading?**
- Check `cdn.sanity.io` is in `next.config.ts` remotePatterns ✅
- Verify images are uploaded in Sanity Studio
- Check browser console for errors

**Studio not starting?**
- Run `npm install` again
- Check no other service using port 3333
- Verify Sanity credentials are correct
