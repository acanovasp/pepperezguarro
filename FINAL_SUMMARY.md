## 📋 What YOU Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Get Sanity API Token (5 minutes)

1. Visit: https://sanity.io/manage
2. Select your project: **"PepPerez"** (ID: vynr1qpf)
3. Go to: **API** → **Tokens**
4. Click: **Add API token**
5. Settings:
   - Name: `Production Website Token`
   - Permissions: **Viewer** (read-only is fine)
6. Copy the token (starts with `sk...`)

### Step 2: Add Token to Environment

Edit the file `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
# Change this line:
SANITY_API_TOKEN=

# To this (paste your actual token):
SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk_your_token_here_xxxxx
```

### Step 3: Start Sanity Studio

Open terminal and run:

```bash
npm run sanity
```

This starts the Studio at `http://localhost:3333`

### Step 4: Create Your First Content

**In Sanity Studio:**

1. **Create About Page:**
   - Click "About" in sidebar
   - Fill in all fields (name, bio, email, phone, instagram, etc.)
   - Click **Publish**

2. **Create First Project:**
   - Click "Projects" in sidebar
   - Click "Create new project" (bottom right)
   - Fill in fields:
     - **Project Number**: `1` (controls order)
     - **Title**: e.g., "Ladakhi Bakers"
     - **Slug**: Click "Generate" button
     - **Location**: e.g., "India"
     - **Year**: e.g., "2025"
     - **Description**: Full description text
     - **Images**: Upload your images (drag & drop or bulk select)
     - **Collaboration, Client, Date**: Optional fields
   - Click **Publish**

3. **Add More Projects:**
   - Repeat step 2 with Project Number 2, 3, 4, etc.
   - Lower numbers appear first on the website

### Step 5: Test Your Website

In a **new terminal** (keep Studio running):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open: `http://localhost:3000`

You should now see your Sanity content live! 🎉

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy Sanity Studio (Access from Anywhere):

```bash
npm run sanity:deploy
```

This deploys Studio to: `https://pepperez.sanity.studio`

You can then edit content from any device, anywhere!

### Deploy Next.js Website:

When deploying to Vercel (or any platform):

1. Add environment variables to your hosting platform:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=vynr1qpf
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk_your_token_here
   ```

2. Deploy normally - everything will work automatically!

## 🔧 Useful Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start Next.js (localhost:3000)
npm run sanity       # Start Sanity Studio (localhost:3333)

# Building
npm run build        # Build Next.js for production

# Deployment
npm run sanity:deploy  # Deploy Studio to Sanity hosting
```

## 🎓 How It Works

### Dual Mode System:

**Without Sanity Token:**
- Shows placeholder data
- Website works normally
- Perfect for development

**With Sanity Token:**
- Fetches real content from Sanity
- Auto-generates image metadata
- Optimized image delivery
- Production mode

### Image Pipeline:

1. Upload image to Sanity (drag & drop, bulk supported)
2. Sanity generates blur placeholder (LQIP)
3. Next.js requests optimized sizes
4. Delivered via Sanity CDN
5. Alt text auto-generated: `ProjectTitle-01`

### Project Ordering:

Projects appear in order based on the **Project Number** field:
- Number 1 → First project
- Number 2 → Second project
- Number 3 → Third project
- etc.

Change the number anytime to reorder!
