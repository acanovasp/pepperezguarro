# Design & Functionality Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Page Transitions Restored
**Problem:** Pages were jumping instantly without fade animations
**Fix:** 
- Restored `TransitionLink` component usage in:
  - `HomeSlider.tsx` - "Open project" link
  - `ProjectSlider.tsx` - "Close project" link  
  - `ImageGrid.tsx` - "Close project" link
- Pages now fade out before navigation (800ms) and fade in on arrival

### 2. ProjectInfo Component Restored on Homepage
**Problem:** Layout broken, missing project number
**Fix:**
- Restored proper state management in `HomePageClient.tsx`
- `ProjectInfo` now renders outside `FadeTransition` wrapper
- Project number calculation restored: `projects.findIndex(p => p.id === activeProject.id) + 1`
- ActiveProject state properly managed and passed to HomeSlider

### 3. Random Image Timing Fixed
**Problem:** Images changing to random image during drag/click, before slide transition
**Fix:**
- Changed `handleSlideChange` to use `setTimeout` with 800ms delay
- New random image now selects AFTER slide transition completes
- Prevents flashing/jumping during slide change animation
- Uses `prevIndexRef` to track actual slide changes (not resize events)

### 4. Image Optimization Restored
**Problem:** Performance optimization settings were removed
**Fix:**
- **HomeSlider:** 
  - Added `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"`
  - Priority only for first slide: `projects.indexOf(project) === 0`
  - Lazy loading for non-priority slides
  - Blur placeholder only for first slide

- **ProjectSlider:**
  - Added `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 90vw, 50vw"`
  - Priority only for initial slide: `index === initialSlide`
  - Lazy loading for ghost images and non-initial slides
  - Proper blur placeholder handling

### 5. Proper Component Initialization
**Problem:** Initial slide not properly communicating with parent
**Fix:**
- `onSwiper` callback now properly initializes:
  - `activeIndex` state
  - `prevIndexRef` tracking
  - Calls `onActiveProjectChange` with initial project
- Ensures ProjectInfo shows correct data on page load

## üîß Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `app/HomePageClient.tsx` - Restored state management and ProjectInfo
2. `components/sliders/HomeSlider.tsx` - Fixed timing, transitions, optimization
3. `components/sliders/ProjectSlider.tsx` - Fixed transitions and optimization  
4. `components/ui/ImageGrid.tsx` - Fixed transitions

### Key Code Patterns Restored:

**State Management:**
```typescript
const [activeProject, setActiveProject] = useState<Project>(projects[0]);
const activeProjectNumber = projects.findIndex(p => p.id === activeProject.id) + 1;
```

**Random Image Timing:**
```typescript
transitionTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
  const newRandom = getRandomImage(activeProject);
  setRandomImages(prev => new Map(prev).set(activeProject.id, newRandom));
}, 800); // Wait for transition to complete
```

**TransitionLink Usage:**
```typescript
<TransitionLink href={`/projects/${project.slug}`} className={styles.openProject}>
  Open project
</TransitionLink>
```

## üéØ What Should Work Now

1. ‚úÖ **Page transitions** - Smooth 800ms fade out before navigation, fade in on arrival
2. ‚úÖ **ProjectInfo on homepage** - Shows with proper layout and project number
3. ‚úÖ **Random images** - Change only AFTER slide transition completes (no flashing during drag/click)
4. ‚úÖ **Image optimization** - Proper responsive sizing and lazy loading
5. ‚úÖ **State management** - Proper tracking of active project across components

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Still To Check

The user mentioned these additional issues that need verification:

1. **Image caption layout** - Need to check if layout matches original design
2. **Navigation arrows (dots)** - User mentioned dots are missing from caption

Please test and let me know if these issues persist or if there are other design changes needed!

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate from homepage to project - Should fade out then fade in
- [ ] Navigate from project back to homepage - Should fade smoothly
- [ ] Change slides on homepage - Image should change AFTER transition, not during
- [ ] Drag slider on homepage - Should not trigger random image change
- [ ] Check ProjectInfo on homepage - Should show project number (01, 02, etc.)
- [ ] Check image caption layout - Verify it matches original design
- [ ] Look for navigation arrow dots - Check if they're visible in caption
